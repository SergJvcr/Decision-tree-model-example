# Decision-tree-model-example
This project is based on the Google Advanced Data analytics certification training assignment. 
The goal of the project: to develop a model that can predict whether a customer will be satisfied with the services of an airline.
Since the outcome variable is binary (0 - dissatisfied, 1 - satisfied), Decision Tree was chosen as the model.
Implementation: sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier().
